                    The Nissan Skyline GT-R (Japanese: 日産・スカイラインGT-R, 
                    Hepburn: Nissan Sukairain GT-R) is a Japanese sports car 
                    based on the Nissan Skyline range. The first cars named 
                    "Skyline GT-R" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under 
                    the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese 
                    touring car racing events. This model was followed by a 
                    brief production run of second-generation cars, under 
                    model code KPGC110, in 1973.

                <p>The engine of the Nissan Skyline 
                    GT-R R34 is one of the most impressive 
                    aspects of the car. Known as the RB26DETT, 
                    it's a twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter inline-six 
                    engine that produces around 280 horsepower 
                    in stock form.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Enhancements to engine cooling led the twin-turbocharged 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) V6 VR38DETT engine to maintain its turbo boost pressure dialed up, increasing engine power output to 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 633 N⋅m (467 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 3,300–5,300 rpm.</p>

                <p>The GT-R had a maximum theoretical output of 276 horsepower with the Japanese Gentlemen Agreement. But several independent tests have often claimed that the figure was somewhere north of 320 horsepower instead.

                <p>The R34 features the most potent version of Nissan's RB26DETT engine, even if the quoted figures state that it produces just 276bhp. But that's just the starting point. With the right modifications it is capable of producing power figures well in excess of 1000bhp</p>

            <p class="para-paul">
                The story goes that Paul Walker was given the freedom by Universal Film Studios to have the GT-R modified in any way that he could see fit for its starring role in the movie. Key modifications made to it include the fitment of a Turbonetics front-mount intercooler, a Rotora brake conversion, and a Nismo NE-1 exhaust. It is claimed that the twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26 engine produces approximately 550 hp, a serious sum for a vehicle of this age. The car was sold by Bonhams for a staggering $1.357 million and in the process, set a new world record for a Skyline GT-R sold at a public auction.
